Based on the constitution wrte a detailed specifications for the physical ai and humunoid robotics book.Include:
Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation + Intecomponent)
  - API communicagrated RAG Chatbot Deployment

Objectives:
1. Write a complete technical book in MDX, structured for Docusaurus.
2. Build, configure, and deploy the Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages.
3. Develop a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using:
   - OpenAI Agents or ChatKit SDKs
   - FastAPI backend
   - Qdrant Cloud Free Tier for vector storage
4. Embed the chatbot into the published Docusaurus site.
5. Ensure the chatbot can:
   - Answer general questions about the book
   - Answer questions based only on user-selected text in the book

Deliverables:
- Docusaurus project folder with:
  - `/docs` containing all chapters (10–15 MDX files)
  - `docusaurus.config.js`
  - `sidebars.js`
  - Deployment configuration for GitHub Pages
- Full RAG backend, including:
  - FastAPI app with retrieval + generation endpoints
  - Qdrant collection setup, embedding pipeline, and indexing scripts
  - Environment configuration (`.env.example`)
- Frontend chatbot widget integrated into Docusaurus:
  - Chat interface (React tion with FastAPI backend
  - Feature for sending user-selected text to the RAG system
- Complete deployment steps for:
  - GitHub Pages (frontend)
  - Backend hosting (local + cloud options)
  - Qdrant Cloud Collection creation
- Testing, debugging, and validation instructions

Content Requirements:
- Follow Docusaurus MDX conventions (headings, callouts, tables, code blocks).
- Each chapter must include:
  - Objective summary
  - Step-by-step guided instructions
  - Verified code snippets
  - Outcome validation steps
  - Troubleshooting notes
- Chapters must cover:
  1. Introduction & project overview
  2. Environment setup (Node.js, Python, Git, Qdrant account)
  3. Creating a Docusaurus project
  4. Writing content in MDX (book structure)
  5. Customizing theme + layout
  6. Sidebar + navigation setup
  7. Deploying to GitHub Pages
  8. Understanding RAG systems
  9. FastAPI backend development
  10. Qdrant vector DB integration
  11. Embedding OpenAI APIs (Agents/ChatKit)
  12. Chatbot UI implementation in Docusaurus
  13. User-selected text → RAG retrieval pipeline
  14. Testing, deploying, and maintaining the system

Technical Standards:
- Code must be fully runnable, verified, and copy-paste ready.
- Use latest stable versions of:
  - Node.js (LTS)
  - Docusaurus
  - FastAPI
  - Qdrant SDK
  - OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs
- Folder paths must be correct and consistent across instructions.
- API routes must be clearly documented (method, path, request/response schema).
- Embeddings and retrieval pipeline must be reproducible.
- All integrations must avoid deprecated commands or outdated APIs.

Format + Output Constraints:
- Entire book must be formatted as MDX files compatible with Docusaurus.
- All code blocks must specify language (```js, ```bash, ```python).
- Images/diagrams must be referenced with placeholders (to insert later).
- Required chapter length: 700–1500 words.
- All docs must be structured to fit inside a Docusaurus sidebar.

Quality Criteria:
- Docusaurus site must build successfully with `npm run build`.
- GitHub Pages deployment must complete without errors.
- Chatbot must:
  - Answer book-related queries accurately
  - Process and answer based on user-selected text only
  - Communicate properly with FastAPI backend
  - Retrieve embeddings from Qdrant successfully
- No broken links, missing files, or invalid code samples.
- Writing must follow Flesch-Kincaid 8–10 clarity level.
- System must be fully reproducible by readers following the book.

Success Definition:
A fully working, deployed Docusaurus site with an integrated, functional RAG chatbot that:
- Understands the book’s content
- Answers questions reliably
- Supports retrieval based on arbitrary user-selected text
- Is documented step-by-step inside the book itself
- Can be reproduced by any developer following the instructions
