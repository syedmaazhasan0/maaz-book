# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This chapter provides a foundational overview of Physical AI and humanoid robotics—fields that merge artificial intelligence with physical machines capable of real-world interaction.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of Physical AI
- Describe humanoid robots and their purpose
- Identify major components of intelligent embodied systems

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence embedded in machines that can sense, move, and interact physically. Unlike digital AI systems, these models operate in real environments.

## What Are Humanoid Robots?
Humanoid robots mimic human structure and behavior, enabling natural interaction in human-designed spaces.

## Summary
This chapter introduced the basic principles of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
