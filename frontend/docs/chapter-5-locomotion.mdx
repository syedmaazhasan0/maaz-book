# Locomotion, Balance & Movement Control

This chapter explores how humanoids walk, keep balance, and perform complex movements.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand gait generation
- Learn how robots maintain balance
- Recognize motion planning algorithms

## Locomotion
Humanoid robots use:
- Zero Moment Point (ZMP)
- Dynamic walking models
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive walking

## Balance Control
Robots constantly adjust posture through IMUs and feedback loops.

## Summary
Movement in humanoid robots is a coordinated blend of sensors, algorithms, and actuators.
