## Prompt

Integration with other AI providers like OpenAI

## Response snapshot

Okay, I understand you'd like to integrate other AI providers like OpenAI. To ensure I'm on the right track, could you clarify the scope of this integration? Are you thinking of:

1.  Replacing the current AI model with one from OpenAI?
2.  Adding the ability to switch between different AI providers (like Gemini and OpenAI)?
3.  Using an OpenAI model for a specific new feature?
4.  Something else?

This will help in drafting a clear specification for the new feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified user request for a new feature and initiated the specification process.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: history/prompts/multi-provider-support/001-initial-request-for-openai-integration.spec.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide clarification on the desired integration.
- 🧠 Reflection: Creating a PHR to track the new feature request and asking clarifying questions before proceeding with implementation.
